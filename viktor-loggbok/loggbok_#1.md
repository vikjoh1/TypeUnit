Loggbok #1 28 march

Worked on the first increment of the UTF domain models. 
Setting up and understanding BridgePoint was a challenge, but today we created two classes 
belonging to the test runner part of TypeUnit. WasRun and TestCase.
I started working at linux first but had problems so I switched over to windows. 
This worked better but here I have completely different problems with BP.
